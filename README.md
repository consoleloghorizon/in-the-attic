You're moving to a new house! A smaller house! A house much too small for all your worldly possessions! Which means it's time to make some TOUGH CHOICES. 

And by TOUGH CHOICES we mean CONVINCE YOUR FRIENDS THAT YOUR STUFF IS RAD AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS RUBBISH.

Play along with up to 8 friends in this Jackbox-style game of questionably valuable possessions. All of you will dream up what you want to keep in your new house, and then decide what belongs in the dumpster.
